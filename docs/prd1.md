# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for RumorWoods 3D Sandbox

This document outlines the requirements for a simple 3D sandbox inspired by Kokiri Village from *The Legend of Zelda*. The goal is to create an immersive, visually engaging environment where the user can freely explore using WASD controls. The project will use Next.js for the application framework and Three.js for the 3D rendering.

## 1. Overview

We aim to build a 3D sandbox that captures the charm and aesthetics of Kokiri Village. The sandbox will be simple, focused on exploration rather than complex gameplay mechanics. The user will navigate the environment using WASD controls, experiencing a lightweight, responsive 3D world.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- **Immersive Environment:** Recreate the look and feel of Kokiri Village with natural elements, simple architecture, and a whimsical style.
- **Smooth Navigation:** Implement WASD movement to allow users to explore freely and comfortably.
- **Lightweight Experience:** Ensure fast load times and smooth performance, suitable for a web-based experience.
- **Clear Structure:** Leverage Next.js for a modular, maintainable project structure and Three.js for dynamic 3D rendering.

## 3. Features & Functionality

### 3.1 Environment
- **Visual Style:** 
  - Design the village with a focus on organic shapes, vibrant colors, and a dreamy atmosphere reminiscent of Kokiri Village.
  - Use low-poly or moderately detailed 3D models to keep the performance optimal.
- **Static Assets:**
  - Include trees, cottages, paths, and water features that evoke the original setting.
  - Integrate simple lighting and shadow effects for depth and realism.

### 3.2 Character Controller
- **Movement Mechanics:**
  - Implement smooth WASD controls for navigation.
  - Basic collision detection to prevent moving through objects.
  - Option for continuous movement and responsive turning.
  
### 3.3 UI/UX
- **Interface:**
  - Minimal on-screen UI to maintain immersion.
  - Optionally, a simple overlay for instructions or game settings.
- **Experience:**
  - Full-screen mode for maximum immersion.
  - Quick startup and load times to reduce user friction.

### 3.4 Technical Stack
- **Next.js:**
  - Manage routing, server-side rendering, and overall project structure.
- **Three.js:**
  - Render the 3D environment.
  - Manage animations and integrate WASD controls into the scene.
- **Performance:**
  - Use asset optimization and efficient rendering techniques to ensure smooth performance on most modern browsers.

## 4. User Stories

- **Explorer:**  
  *As a user, I want to navigate a beautifully rendered 3D environment using WASD keys, so I can explore a virtual Kokiri Village at my own pace.*

- **Seeker:**  
  *As a user, I expect the environment to load quickly and the controls to be responsive, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience.*

- **Minimalist:**  
  *As a user, I prefer a clean interface that keeps my focus on exploration without unnecessary distractions.*
